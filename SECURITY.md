# Security Policy

## Reporting

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

For now, report security concerns privately to the repository owner through GitHub security reporting if enabled, or through a private direct channel.

## Project sensitivity

Blueprints handles:

- signed project data
- membership authority
- tamper detection
- audit history

Changes in these areas should be reviewed conservatively.

## Supported versions

This repository is pre-release. Security fixes, when applicable, will target the current `main` branch first.
